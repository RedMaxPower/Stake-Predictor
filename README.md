This repository provides a simulation-based Plinko game and a basic bot that analyzes drop outcomes, patterns, and expected values. The purpose is to study the probability distribution and behavior of the Plinko system through a programmable environment.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulates a customizable Plinko board
- Tracks ball drop outcomes and calculates frequency distributions
- Predicts optimal drop positions (based on math, not real-world casino hacks)
- Visualizes results with graphs
- 100% open-source and legal

> ⚠️ This project is strictly for educational and statistical simulation purposes. It does **not** interact with or attempt to modify any live casino systems or violate terms of service.
